# Syringe Pump

The syringe pump is a compact device designed to steadily deliver precise volumes of liquid.  
Applications include healthcare (accurate drug delivery) and scientific research (controlled reagent addition).  

**Key Features:**
- **Adjustable Flow Rate:** 1 ÂµL/min up to 10 mL/min, controlled in Arduino.  
- **LED Status Indicators:** Green = running, Yellow = paused, Red = syringe empty.  
- **Single-Button Control:** Simplifies operation for quick start/pause.  
- **Safety Measures:** Limit switch prevents over-travel; enclosed electronics reduce contamination risk.  
- **Modular Design:** 3D-printed supports allow syringes of varying diameters to be used interchangeably.  
- **Cost-Effective Fabrication:** Most parts printed in PLA; high-heat components in ABS.

# How to Operate the Syringe Pump

1. **Prepare Setup**  
   - Upload Arduino code to the microcontroller.  
   - Load syringe with desired liquid.  

2. **Insert Syringe**  
   - Rest syringe tip on front support.  
   - Slide plunger into back support.  

3. **Adjust Carriage**  
   - Twist coupler until carriage rests against plunger.  

4. **Input Parameters**  
   - Enter syringe internal diameter (mm) and desired flow rate (mL/min).  

5. **Run Pump**  
   - Press the button once to start.  
   - LED color indicates status: Green = running, Yellow = paused, Red = empty.
